1. We create a ballot for c and then vote for it.
2. After going through the code, it can be learned that Goal is to edit the ballot json in such a way that the value of votes added to A and B makes it lesser than C. 
3. , we can see that it doesn't verify the integrity of the json produced.
4. Changing the count in json would achieve this task.
5. Just tried cracking this by trying different combinations of counts for a and b so that it becomes negative/zero somehow.
